1. Warehouse: A warehouse is a virtual computing resource in Snowflake that can be used to process data. Warehouses are used to separate processing resources from storage resources, and they can be easily scaled up or down as needed.
2. Database: A database is a collection of logically organized data in Snowflake. Databases contain tables, views, and other objects, and they provide a way to organize data into logical groups.
3. Table: A table is a database object in Snowflake that contains data organized into rows and columns. Tables are used to store structured data in Snowflake.
4. View: A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT statement. Views can be used to simplify complex queries or to provide a restricted view of data.
5. Role: A role is a named collection of privileges in Snowflake. Roles are used to grant permissions to users and to simplify the process of managing permissions.
6. User: A user is an account in Snowflake that represents a person or system that accesses data. Users can be assigned roles to control the permissions they have in Snowflake.
7. Stage: A stage is a location in Snowflake where data files can be uploaded, stored, and processed. Stages can be either internal or external, and they can be used to simplify the process of loading data into Snowflake.
8. File Format: A file format is a definition of how data is stored in Snowflake. File formats can be used to define the structure of data, such as the separators used in a CSV file, or the compression type used for a GZIP file.
9. Pipe: A pipe is a named set of steps in Snowflake that are used to process data as it is loaded into Snowflake. Pipes can be used to simplify the process of loading data into Snowflake and to enforce data quality standards.
10. Task: A task is a unit of work in Snowflake that is used to automate a specific process, such as data loading or data transformations. Tasks can be scheduled to run at specific times, or they can be triggered by events, such as the arrival of new data.
11. Micro-Partition: A micro-partition is the smallest unit of data storage in Snowflake. Micro-partitions are used to manage the storage of data within Snowflake and to optimize query performance.
12. Result Cache: A result cache is a feature in Snowflake that caches the results of frequently executed queries. Result caches are used to improve query performance by avoiding the need to recompute the results of expensive queries.
13. Materialized View: A materialized view is a pre-computed view that stores the results of a SELECT statement in a table. Materialized views are used to improve query performance by providing faster access to frequently used data.
14. Time Travel: Time Travel is a feature in Snowflake that allows users to query data as it existed at a specific point in time. Time Travel is used to support auditing, regulatory compliance, and other use cases that require historical data access.
15. Virtual Warehouse: A virtual warehouse is a computing resource in Snowflake that is used to process queries. Virtual warehouses are used to separate processing resources from storage resources and to allow for flexible scaling of processing resources.
16. Stream: A stream is a named set of steps in Snowflake that are used to process data as it is streamed into Snowflake. Streams can be used to process real-time data and to implement complex event processing.
17. Share: A share is a way to share data and metadata with other Snowflake accounts. Shares are used to support collaboration between different organizations and to support data sharing between different groups within an organization.
18. Data Exchange: A data exchange is a feature in Snowflake that enables data sharing between different Snowflake accounts. Data exchanges are used to support data sharing between different organizations and to support data sharing between different groups within an organization.
19. Multi-Cloud: Multi-cloud is a feature in Snowflake that enables users to store data in multiple cloud storage providers. Multi-cloud is used to support data redundancy and to support the migration of data between different cloud storage providers.
