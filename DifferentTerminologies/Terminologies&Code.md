1. Warehouse: A warehouse is a processing unit in Snowflake that you can use to execute queries and perform other operations. It acts as a layer between the storage and the compute resources in Snowflake.
Here's how you can create a warehouse in Snowflake:

CREATE WAREHOUSE <warehouse_name>
  WITH 
  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
  AUTO_SUSPEND = 60 
  AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
  MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1 
  MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 3


2. Database: A database is a container for organizing tables, views, and other database objects in Snowflake. You can use a database to isolate your data and to grant different levels of access to different users.
Here's how you can create a database in Snowflake:

CREATE DATABASE <database_name>


3. Schema: A schema is a container within a database that you can use to organize tables and views. Schemas can be used to grant different levels of access to different groups of users.
Here's how you can create a schema in Snowflake:


CREATE SCHEMA <schema_name>


4. Table: A table is a database object that stores data in a structured format. Tables can be used to store both structured and semi-structured data, such as JSON or Avro.
Here's how you can create a table in Snowflake:


CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
  <column_name_1> <data_type_1>,
  <column_name_2> <data_type_2>,
  ...
);


5. View: A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT statement. Views can be used to simplify complex queries and to provide a simplified view of the data.
Here's how you can create a view in Snowflake:


CREATE VIEW <view_name> AS
SELECT 
  <column_name_1>,
  <column_name_2>,
  ...
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <condition>;
